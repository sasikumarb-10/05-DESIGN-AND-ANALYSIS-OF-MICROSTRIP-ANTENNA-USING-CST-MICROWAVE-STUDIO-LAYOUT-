**Conclusion:**

The quarter wave transformer was succesfully designed using CST Microwave studio to match mico strip line with a 123 ohm load.

From this experiment we got the bandwidth value of 1.33 Ghz with a impedance matching of 78.42 ohm and also got the width of quarter wave line of 1.138 mm..
